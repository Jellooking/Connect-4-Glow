### **_Objective_**

####  Guide the jello through a hazardous environment filled with obstacles and keep it alive for as long as possible.
---

### **_Gameplay_**

- Controls: Use the arrow keys or mouse to move the jello.
- Obstacles: The game world is filled with various obstacles such as spikes, moving platforms, falling objects, and enemies. The jello must avoid touching these obstacles to survive.
 - Power-ups: Occasionally, power-ups like speed boosts or temporary invincibility can appear to help the jello navigate through difficult sections.
 - Scoring: The score increases as the jello survives longer. Considering to implement a leaderboard to encourage competition among players :D.
- Difficulty: The game can gradually increase in difficulty by introducing faster obstacles or more complex level designs as the player progresses.

### **_Visuals and Audio_**

- Visuals: Use colorful and vibrant graphics to depict the jello and the environment. Considering to use different themes or backgrounds to add variety.

- Audio: Will background music that matches the game's theme and sound effects for actions like jumping, collecting power-ups, or colliding with obstacles.

### **_Level Design_**

- Design levels with increasing complexity and will introduce new obstacles and challenges as the player advances.

- Create narrow passages, moving platforms, and tight spaces to add difficulty and test the player's agility.

### **_Pseudocode_**
-creating a dpad movement
-adding a gamepad feature
-using a canvas to make the game in one place
-for the speed powerup I will use velocity 
-the rest i will figure it out :D
